Brace yourself for a tale of intrigue, innovation, and a touch of darkness!&nbsp;</p><p>But First, What on Earth is Muerte KOD? üòØ‚ùì</p><p>I know, I know, the name might raise a few eyebrows. So, let me clarify: Muerte, which means \"death\" or \"murder\" in English, was a \"legal\" Windows software designed to enhance the gaming experience for the immensely popular game, PUBG Mobile. Now, before you call the authorities on me, let me assure you that the software itself didn't do anything wrong. It simply consisted of a collection of small tools aimed at helping players enjoy the game to the fullest. üòÖüîß</p><p>[link]https://github.com/HSinghHira/MuerteKOD/releases[/link]</p><p>Creating Muerte KOD was both a challenge and an opportunity for me. It marked my first and, so far, my last venture into software development using Microsoft Visual Studio. I poured my heart and soul into this project, striving to provide as many useful features as possible for the gamers. üí™</p><p>I dedicated countless hours to refining the software, ensuring that it not only delivered the desired functionality but also boasted an improved visual design. After all, a visually appealing interface can truly elevate the gaming experience. üöÄüé®</p><p>Muerte KOD, with its name meaning \"death\" or \"murder\" in English, added an extra layer of intrigue to this exhilarating journey. Although the software aimed to enhance gameplay through various tools like MAC address spoofing, Defender Injector, Flush DNS, Advanced DNS Changer, HDD ID Changer, and more, it's important to note that it was all within the realm of legality. No rules were broken, I promise! üòâüîí</p><p>While Muerte KOD stands as my first and, for now, my last software endeavor using Microsoft Visual Studio, I cherish the experience and the knowledge gained along the way. It serves as a testament to the limitless possibilities that await us in the realm of game enhancement.</p><p>So, fellow gamers, keep exploring, keep innovating, and let's continue to push the boundaries of what we can achieve in the world! Game on! üéÆüåü</p>"

It all started with a simple task: putting dough tags on newly made dough batches. It was a crucial health and safety requirement, and I hope they still follow it. But little did I know that this experience would lead me down a rabbit hole of Excel wonders. üé©üíª</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">One day, during a not-so-busy shift, I couldn't help but notice that the dough tags we were using weren't exactly visually appealing. You know, they lacked that wow factor. ü§î So, when I got home, I decided to fire up Excel on my laptop to see if I could create better-looking tags. A quick Google search for inspiration, and voila! I had some good-looking tags ready to go. üè∑Ô∏èüåü</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But then, it hit me. I would still have to manually enter all the details for each tag. üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Determined to find a solution, I hit the search button once again and stumbled upon the magnificent world of Macros and VBA (Visual Basic for Applications for full, I know fancy name üòë). üöÄ</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">With newfound knowledge, I started with a simple file. It was nothing fancy, just a basic automation to ease the manual data entry process. Little did I know that this was just the beginning of an exciting journey. Every step of the way, I continued to develop and improve my Excel project. üìà</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the end, I created something truly remarkable. If you're curious to see the different versions I released, head over to the GitHub repository. Unfortunately, I must confess that I no longer remember the password for the VBA, so you won't be able to view the codes behind the magic. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">[link]https://github.com/HSinghHira/Dominos-Pizza-Dough-Tagger/releases[/link]</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This project is a true testament to the wonders of Excel and VBA. Despite not remembering much about VBA or even how to perform simple calculations in Excel, I somehow managed to create this masterpiece. It's like a puzzle I solved without remembering how I did it. üß©üí°</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And guess what? If the need arises, I can create an even better Excel project than this one. Trust me, the possibilities are endless! üí™</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So there you have it, my extraordinary Excel adventure at Domino's Pizza. Who would have thought that a simple task like dough tags would lead me down the path of Excel wizardry? üåü‚ú®</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Never underestimate the power of a curious mind and the vast capabilities of Microsoft Excel. Remember, with a little creativity and the right tools, you can build a whole new software-like system right within Excel itself. üöÄüíª</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Stay curious, keep exploring, and who knows what other wonders await us in the world of spreadsheets! üåàüìä</p>"

It was back in 2016, and \"Dekh Bhai\" memes were all the rage in India. The phrase \"Dekh Bhai\" means \"Look Brother\" in English. These memes originated from an Indian TV series called Dekh Bhai Dekh. I saw this project as a challenge and an opportunity to learn something new. Since I was still a beginner in JavaScript, it took me about a month to complete. The entire script was written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p><p>[link]https://git.hsinghhira.me/LookBro/[/link]</p><p><a href=\"#\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"911\" data-original-width=\"1871\" height=\"312\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgAjPvbPa0iX5aoqHf19aFPTOjfTJiTgihgjkD2W3PDTXTFOLjYWorMaqOYSdi8ycb_m5C66B1XPMlB5apM73xG_MTow_iZe8e2p2x2hl0IKuYT1uxlpdp_QuxYVSs85_axufEGUfeDOMn1de3BqInsHE_tYAELi15nPXqS4NK-JC4g4GbwYb0A2syOin0H/w640-h312/dekh-bhai.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></p><div><p>For the framework, I chose to use Bootstrap. It was easier for me to work with since I had been using Bootstrap for most of my projects. Bootstrap is a very popular CSS framework that helps in developing websites that are responsive and mobile-friendly.</p><p>To further enhance and support the script, I also utilized Normalize.css by Nicolas Gallagher. This helped ensure consistent rendering across different browsers.</p><p>To create the text-to-image functionality, I relied on Fabric.js. Fabric.js is a powerful and user-friendly JavaScript HTML5 canvas library. It provides an interactive object model on top of the canvas element and even includes an SVG-to-canvas (and canvas-to-SVG) parser.</p><p>In order to change the color of the texts, I utilized Prism.js by Lea Verou. Prism.js is a lightweight and versatile syntax highlighter.</p><p>For the left-hand side characters selection box, I implemented nanoScroller by James F. nanoScroller.js is a jQuery plugin that simplifies the implementation of Mac OS X Lion-styled scrollbars.</p><p>To select colors, I used JSColor.js by Jan Odvarko. This lightweight JavaScript library made it easy to choose colors within the project.</p><p>Lastly, I incorporated socialShare.js by Ritesh Kumar, a deprecated jQuery plugin that used to provide more control over social sharing buttons. Unfortunately, the script is no longer available in 2024.</p><p>To support all the JavaScript mentioned above, I utilized jQuery v2.1.0.</p><p>The rest of the scripts were developed by me.</p></div>"
